# Numerical Tasks for Quantum Computing Sheet3
## Luca Gawalleck

The `python` file contains my implemented code. It can be compiled with

```python3 sheet3.py```

It requires the `numpy` library. Beside the required test $\mathrm{CNOT}_{12}\mathrm{H}_1|00\rangle$ 
it shows also different test. The required one is highlighted with hashtags.

The `R` file contains code using the `qsimulatR` package for comparing the results 
with the own implementation. It can be compiled with

```Rscript sheet3.R```
