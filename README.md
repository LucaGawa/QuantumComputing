# Numerical Tasks for Quantum Computing 
## Luca Gawalleck

### Sheet 3
The `python` file contains my implemented code. It can be compiled with

```python3 sheet3/sheet3.py```

It requires the `numpy` library. Beside the required test $\mathrm{CNOT}_{12}\mathrm{H}_1|00\rangle$ 
it shows also different test. The required one is highlighted with hashtags.

The `R` file contains code using the `qsimulatR` package for comparing the results 
with the own implementation. It can be compiled with

```Rscript sheet3/sheet3.R```


### Sheet 4
Compiling with

```Rscript sheet4/sheet4.R```

package `qsimulatR` is required.

```Rplots.pdf``` contains the circuit for task 6 and the histogram for task 8.

### Sheet 6 
Compiling with

```Rscript sheet6/sheet6.R```

package `qsimulatR` is required.
